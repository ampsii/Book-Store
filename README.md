---How to use---
----------------

Depending on the type of user(Administrator or client), the user is prompted to log in the application via it's designated button. New users can also create new accounts in order to use the application. In the Admin panel, the person can opt to view the items he has in store with all the information available, add new items to the store, or delete items from the store if the list is outdated. Meanwhile, a user/customer can see the items the store has and if she/he would like to make a purchase,he could add those same items to his individual shopping cart. When he thinks he is done shopping, he can choose the appropriate payment method and the corresponding actions will follow.

-----------Notable bugs------

Other than common syntax related bugs, one of the biggest bugs consisted in the quantity property of an item not being updated once the item was removed from the cart as you should see below.
